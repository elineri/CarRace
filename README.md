# Labb3 Threads

## About
This is a school assignment for the course 'Avancerad .NET' to test threads and asyncronous solutions. 
The assignment was to create a car race in a console application with at least two cars. 
During the race different obstacles can happen which either slows the cars down or makes them stop for a while.
